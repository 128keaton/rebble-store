# Rebble Store for pebble
Rebble Store is a Pebble App store.
If you want to contribute send us a PM.

## Requirements
UI requires `NPM` and `Grunt`.

## Build Process
What does this build process do? It compiles Bootstrap 4 scss, minifies the HTML, Compiles the project's scss, minifies the css, and outputs it all to the `build` folder.

1. If you haven't already run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies.
2. To build UI just run `grunt build`. You will see the output in the `build` folder.


**Note:** `grunt Watch` hasn't been implemented yet.
